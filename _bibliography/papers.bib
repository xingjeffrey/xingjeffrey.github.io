	abstract = {The acoustic structure of birdsong is spectrally and temporally complex. Temporal complexity is often investigated in a syntactic framework focusing on the statistical features of symbolic song sequences. Alternatively, temporal patterns can be investigated in a rhythmic framework that focuses on the relative timing between song elements. Here, we investigate the merits of combining both frameworks by integrating syntactic and rhythmic analyses of Australian pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis) songs, which exhibit organized syntax and diverse rhythms. We show that rhythms of the pied butcherbird song bouts in our sample are categorically organized and predictable by the song’s first-order sequential syntax. These song rhythms remain categorically distributed and strongly associated with the first-order sequential syntax even after controlling for variance in note length, suggesting that the silent intervals between notes induce a rhythmic structure on note sequences. We discuss the implication of syntactic–rhythmic relations as a relevant feature of song complexity with respect to signals such as human speech and music, and advocate for a broader conception of song complexity that takes into account syntax, rhythm, and their interaction with other acoustic and perceptual features.},

	title = {Examining song complexity of {Australian} pied butcherbirds},
	abstract = {Songbird vocal communication signals (birdsongs) often evolve in secondary sexual selection contexts and are shaped by female preferences. Such female preferences to male songs are typically linked to information-theoretic features of song complexity such as repertoire size or syntax of discrete song elements. Recent discoveries of similar structures between birdsong and human music suggest, however, that musical features of song complexity may also be relevant to female preferences. Australian pied butcherbirds (Cracticus nigrogularis) exhibit songs with recombinatory syntax and structural similarities to human music, but the depth of their song complexity remains ill-defined. To holistically examine pied butcherbird song complexity, we characterized relevant features of song complexity through a combination of symbolic sequence and musical rhythm analysis. This integrated approach reveals long-range dependencies in pied butcherbird songs, in which song elements are dependent on song history, and strong categorical song rhythms, in which the temporal spacings between song element onsets occur at discretely organized intervals. As categorical song rhythms can facilitate song history encoding, it may be critical in enabling long-range dependencies in pied butcherbird songs. A systematic conception of song complexity that takes into account such potential interactions between song features stands to benefit songbird communication research.},
