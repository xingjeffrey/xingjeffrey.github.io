Researcher interested broadly in the intersection between vocal communication, emotion perception, and sound preference. I take a highly interdisciplinary approach to my research, ranging from modeling basic perceptual processes using machine-learning, testing animals/humans in natural vocal communication tasks using qualitative/quantitative methods, scanning/analyzing brain-imaging data, to assessing/informing medical student empathy training. 

Currently a Ph.D. candidate at [UCSD Psychology](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/). Proud member of the [Gentner / Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory](https://gentnerlab.ucsd.edu/). Advised by Dr. Timothy Q. Gentner @ UCSD Psychology. 

Outside of work, I like to cook, bake, and [writing](https://foodiepostcards.com/) about food in general.
